1. Loading data locally using mysql
2. Scheduling scripts to run at a given time
3. writing scripts with bash
4. It's about MYSQL BTW.. DON'T FORGET

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
A simple weather database project. A certain truck company wants to keep track of weather conditions on major cities along its route.
To obtain this data, the truck company receives the weather data from a certain weather station, every 5 minutes as a .CSV file through 
a FTP. 

This is where the magic happens. A script has to run every 5 minute to check wether a .CSV file has been recieved.
If a new .CSV file is loaded through the FTP, the script automatically runs the SQL files that upload the data from the .CSV file into the 
database. 

I know its confusing..... That's why I have included this....
